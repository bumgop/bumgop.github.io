# About

I hold a B.S. in Software Engineering and certifications including AWS Cloud Practitioner, ITIL 4 Foundations, and CompTIA Project+.

My interests lie in building systems capable of evolving over time: adaptive software, data-driven feedback loops, and tools that improve through iteration.

I value: 
- Clear problem definitions
- Measurable outcomes
- Maintainable architecture
- Thoughtful tradeoffs

Outside of work, I enjoy systems-oriented game design, robotics and electronics, and continuous learning.
